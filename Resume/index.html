<!-- After many years of working in various offices for nonprofits and for-profits and museums and universities and startups, I realized that I'd somehow gone down a path of office work about which I don't feel passionate. If you're reading this, it's because you might be considering me for a coding position. Hopefully you like what you see! But even if you don't want me to do your coding, maybe throw me some constructive criticisms of my github portfolio or resume - I'd be forever grateful. Cheers -Mary -->

          A boutique ecommerce web-development company, I was brought in to fix their accounting system and practices, create spending and ROI analyses, implement cost-saving actions, and identify work process improvements.

          SPARKcon is a local arts showcase based in Raleigh, NC. Entirely volunteer-run, the festival highlights any creative local talent and provides unique cross-pollination through collaborative efforts amongst the best creatives in the Triangle. As musicSPARK director, I led a team of about 20 volunteers to organize, curate, market, and produce a four day free music festival with over 100 acts across 15 venues. As SPARKcon director, I worked directly with the four other directors on logistics, planning, and coordination for the entire festival.
