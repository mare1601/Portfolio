<!-- After many years of working in various offices for nonprofits and for-profits and museums and universities and startups, I realized that I'd somehow gone down a path of office work that I don't really feel passionate about. If you're reading this, it's because you actually might be considering me for a coding position. Hopefully you like what you see! But even if you don't want me to do your coding, maybe throw me some constructive criticisms of my github portfolio or resume - I'd be forever grateful. Cheers -Mary -->

Having spent my career working with data in varying ways - finance, project management, payroll - switching tracks to Front End Development integrates my love of logic with my passion for creating and creative problem solving. I'm bright, hard working, and energetic, and I'm looking for a positive place where I can learn and grow with a likeminded team.
